## Greenspark Interview Task

### Brief

- You can find a figma prototype here. Please make sure that you sign up/login to Figma, so you can investigate the design details. We also recommend to make a copy of the design for yourself
- You can fetch the product card details from https://getgreenspark.mocklab.io/products
- We would like you to implement the design using the product details by using a tech-stack of your choice, however we would like you to be proud of the quality of your final code and tests
- Although we don't have a strict requirement on the due date, finishing the homework should take only a few hours, so ideally we would like to see your solution within a week.
- Once you're done, please send us a link of your repository and a screenshot of your implemented design
